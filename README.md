Execution: just download python notebook with the test data folder and execute the notebook. (We have used jupyter application for programming.)<br/>
Libraries: some libraries like nltk, stopwords, etc. might need to be downloaded. In our laptop, it was already installed. In case it is not installed in any system, the output error will guide as to what needs to be done.<br/>
Note: "ValueError: Hypothesis is empty." may be there for some blocks in the notebook. In that case, the resulting ROUGE-1 score are also calculated manually in another block.<br/>
